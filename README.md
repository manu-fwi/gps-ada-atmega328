gps logger for a breadboard-like arduino uno

This is a version of my gps-ada project for an atmega328 on a small board to save power; power is coming from a LiPo and a voltager booster, no linear regulator. Also I put the CPU to sleep as much as possible, the only power hungry part is the gps by far.
